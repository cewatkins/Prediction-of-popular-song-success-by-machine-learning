Hit song prediction is one of the popular engineering problems that have been working on in recent years.
To predict whether is song will be popular before its launched has important role in music industry. 
In this project, audio- based music dataset is created from official videos on YouTube and they were stored in different
popularity categories (low-medium-high) depending on their corresponding view counts. 
For extracting audio features Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) were used in this project. 
In first part of this project, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained to achieve the classification problem and 
for the second part of this project LSTM Neural Network was implemented.
